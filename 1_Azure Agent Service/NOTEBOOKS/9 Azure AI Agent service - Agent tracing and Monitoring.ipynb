    "    Before running the sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install azure-ai-projects azure-ai-agents azure-identity azure-monitor-opentelemetry\n",

    "    Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "    1) PROJECT_ENDPOINT - The Azure AI Project endpoint, as found in the Overview\n",
    "                          page of your Azure AI Foundry portal.\n",
    "    2) MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - The deployment name of the AI model, as found under the \"Name\" column in\n",
    "       the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "    3) AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED - Optional. Set to `true` to trace the content of chat\n",
    "       messages, which may contain personal data. False by default.\n",
    "    4) APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING - Set to the connection string of your Application Insights resource.\n",
    "       This is used to send telemetry data to Azure Monitor. You can also get the connection string programmatically\n",
    "       from AIProjectClient using the `telemetry.get_connection_string` method. A code sample showing how to do this\n",
