    "    python sample_agents_basics_with_azure_monitor_tracing.py\n",
    "\n",
    "    Before running the sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install azure-ai-projects azure-ai-agents azure-identity azure-monitor-opentelemetry\n",
    "\n",
    "    Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "    1) PROJECT_ENDPOINT - The Azure AI Project endpoint, as found in the Overview\n",
    "                          page of your Azure AI Foundry portal.\n",
    "    2) MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - The deployment name of the AI model, as found under the \"Name\" column in\n",
    "       the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "    3) AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED - Optional. Set to `true` to trace the content of chat\n",
    "       messages, which may contain personal data. False by default.\n",
    "    4) APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING - Set to the connection string of your Application Insights resource.\n",
    "       This is used to send telemetry data to Azure Monitor. You can also get the connection string programmatically\n",
    "       from AIProjectClient using the `telemetry.get_connection_string` method. A code sample showing how to do this\n",

      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Solving Differential Equations**\n",
      "- The Laplace transform converts complex **differential equations** (which are difficult to solve directly) into **algebraic equations** (which are simpler to handle).\n",
      "- Once solved in the Laplace (frequency) domain, the inverse Laplace transform converts the solution back to the original time domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Control Systems Engineering**\n",
      "- Used to analyze and design **control systems** (like those in robotics, industrial automation, aircraft, etc.).\n",
      "- Helps in determining the stability and response of systems to inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Signal Processing**\n",
      "- Used to analyze time-domain signals and systems by transforming them into a complex frequency domain.\n",
      "- Makes convolution (integral operation) turn into multiplication (algebraic operation), simplifying calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Circuit Analysis**\n",
      "- Used to analyze **electrical circuits** (RLC circuits, for example) by transforming circuit equations into a form that is easier to solve, especially when circuits include switches or other time-dependent components.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **5. System Modeling**\n",
      "- Helps represent complex physical systems (mechanical, thermal, chemical) mathematically to predict system behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **6. Initial Value Problems**\n",
