    "    2) MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - The deployment name of the AI model, as found under the \"Name\" column in\n",
    "       the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "    3) AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED - Optional. Set to `true` to trace the content of chat\n",

    "    4) APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING - Set to the connection string of your Application Insights resource.\n",
    "       This is used to send telemetry data to Azure Monitor. You can also get the connection string programmatically\n",
