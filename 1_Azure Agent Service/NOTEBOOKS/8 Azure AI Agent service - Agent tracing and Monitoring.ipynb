    "    2) MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - The deployment name of the AI model, as found under the \"Name\" column in\n",
    "       the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "    3) AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED - Optional. Set to `true` to trace the content of chat\n",
    "       messages, which may contain personal data. False by default.\n",
    "    4) APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING - Set to the connection string of your Application Insights resource.\n",
    "       This is used to send telemetry data to Azure Monitor. You can also get the connection string programmatically\n",
    "       from AIProjectClient using the `telemetry.get_connection_string` method. A code sample showing how to do this\n",

      "\n",
      "### 1. **Set Up Your Environment**\n",
      "- Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (if it’s not already on your computer).\n",
      "- Use a beginner-friendly code editor, such as [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Follow an Interactive Tutorial**\n",
      "- Try websites like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3), [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/), or [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). They let you write and test code in your browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Start With the Basics**\n",
      "Focus on core concepts:\n",
      "- Syntax, printing, basic math\n",
      "- Variables and data types (strings, integers, floats)\n",
      "- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries\n",
      "- If/else statements, loops (for, while)\n",
      "- Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Practice with Simple Projects**\n",
      "- Write small programs: a calculator, number guess game, to-do list.\n",
      "- Use sites like [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/tracks/python), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-python), or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) for practice problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Learn Regularly (Short Lessons Daily)**\n",
      "- 20–30 minutes a day is more effective than long sessions once a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Get Involved in the Community**\n",
      "- Join forums ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python), [Reddit r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/)) for help and motivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Use Free Books and Resources**\n",
      "- “[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)” is excellent for beginners.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
