      "\n",
      "Best Practices:\n",
      "- The code is well structured and modular by encapsulating logic inside the get_stock_price function.\n",
      "- The use of main guard (if __name__ == \"__main__\") is appropriate for script execution entry point.\n",
      "- It includes user-friendly messages and error handling for missing data.\n",
      "- The script uses f-string formatting which is modern and readable.\n",
