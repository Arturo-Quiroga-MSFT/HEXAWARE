      "\n",
      "Correctness:\n",
      "- The program correctly initializes the tic tac toe board as a 3x3 grid.\n",
      "- It allows two players (X and O) to take turns entering their moves.\n",
      "- Input validation is handled to ensure that the player enters valid row and column numbers, and the position is free.\n",
      "- The function check_winner correctly checks rows, columns, and both diagonals for a win condition.\n",
      "- The program correctly ends the game if a player wins or if all positions are filled, resulting in a draw.\n",
      "- The game board is printed after each move, providing clear visual feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improvements:\n",
      "1. Code Readability: Adding comments and docstrings to functions would improve code readability and maintainability.\n",
      "2. Input Robustness: The input handling could be more robust by handling edge cases such as extra spaces, non-numeric inputs more gracefully.\n",
      "3. User Experience: \n",
      "   - Add instructions before the first move explaining the input format.\n",
      "   - After a game ends, prompt the users if they want to play again without restarting the program.\n",
      "4. Performance: The program is simple and performant for its purpose, no changes needed here.\n",
      "5. Code Structure: Consider separating the game logic and user interface parts to make the code more modular, which can help with future enhancements (e.g., adding AI opponent).\n",
      "6. Error Handling: Use exception handling in a broader scope to catch unexpected errors gracefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the program is functionally correct and well-implemented for a console-based tic tac toe game for two players. The suggestions above would help improve usability, robustness, and maintainability.\n",
